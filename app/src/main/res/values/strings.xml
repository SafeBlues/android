    <string name="tv_howitworks_explanation_1">We use Bluetooth signals to spread digital tokens between your phone and the phones of other Safe Blues users around you. This spread of tokens acts similarly to the spread of real airborne disease.</string>
    <string name="tv_howitworks_explanation_2">The Safe Blues experiment is a digital simulation and completely isolated. It is not related to your health status, or the health status of others in any way.</string>
    <string name="tv_howitworks_explanation_3">The app communicates with the Safe Blues server daily to sync anonymized simulation data.</string>
